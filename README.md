# ActivityLifecycle

Every instance of Activity has a lifecycle. During this lifecycle, an activity transitions between three states: running, paused, and stopped. For each transition, there is an Activity method that notifies the activity of the change in its state. Figure 3.1 shows the activity lifecycle, states, and methods.
